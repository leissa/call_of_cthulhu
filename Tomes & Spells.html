<ul>
<li>Found: Penhew Foundation</li>
<li>French, by Ghyslain D’Aramitz, 1807.</li>
<li>Octavo, soft calf leather binding, pages untrimmed.</li>
<li>The account of a French merchant, colonial administrator, and explorer telling of his experiences traveling around the world, with particular chapters devoted to cataloguing and comparing regional customs and beliefs in Northern Africa, Asia, and Europe. D’Aramitz relishes in describing what appear to be outlandish (possibly fictional) practices concerning farming and hunting; however, these are interspersed with dramatic and chilling folk customs that have the ring of authenticity. A number of apparent medieval rituals, stemming from the south of France, are shown to have dark and murderous origins.</li>
<li>There are numerous mentions of god- like entities and avatars: “Witch Maker,” “Bloody Tongue,” and “Three-Eyed Shadow”. Of particular relevance is a description of a mark cut into the skin of enemies of the Bloody Tongue (the same as seen on Jackson Elias’ forehead). Additionally, a passage details an excursion to find the “Black Mountain where the Bloody Tongue dwells” in “Kirinyaga”, where D’Aramitz claims to have seen unholy rites.</li>

<li>Found: In the possession of Richard Rich Sharp in Shinkolobwe, Uranium Mine, Belgian Congo</li>
<li>English, by Sir Wade Jermyn, 1742-1764.</li>
<li>Sir Wade Jermyn was one of the earliest explorers of the Congo region, and had written eruditely of its tribes, animals, and suppoed antiquities. It also includes passages about his bizarre conjectures on a prehistoric white Congolese civilization. These “White Apes” and their “City of the White Gorilla” is located on Kwidjwi, an isle in Lake Kivu. Sir Wade Jermyn also talks about an extraterrestrial being that these “White Apes” either tried to summon or to awake in the lake. The tome describes rites and magic spells Sir Jermyn learned during his adventures and partly researched himself.</li>

<li>Arabic, by Ghalib al-Sabbah, c. 797. Sextodecimo, bound in goatskin with bronze clasp, sulfurous smell.</li>
<li>Heretical work alleged to be the transcript of a series of discussions held by the author with a “djinn,” a being of “scorching fire,” which related all manner of esoteric and forbidden lore. While most of the knowledge contained appears to be fanciful, a few kernels of Mythos knowledge are hidden in the text.</li>

<li>Egyptian hieroglyphs, by Luveh-Keraphf, c. Thirteenth Dynasty Egypt (1786-1633 BCE).</li>
<li>Ten fragile papyrus scrolls, handwritten</li>
<li>Almost every inch of each scroll is covered with tiny, crabbed Egyptian hieroglyphs. The first scroll in the sequence identifies its author as Luveh-Keraphf, High Priest of the cat goddess, Bast. The first few scrolls then discuss the worship of Bast in great detail, including means for summoning Bast and her feline kindred. Later scrolls outline the worship of other Egyptian deities. Particular mention is made of “the Terrible Lord of the Riverbanks,” the crocodile-headed Sebek. His riverside temples are described, along with the rituals for sacrifices made in his name. Cautionary chapters, devoted to the darker members of the Egyptian pantheon, are also included.</li>

<li>Hindi, by Alsophocus, 1517, translator unknown. Duodecimo, bound in black calfskin, original iron clasp broken off.</li>
<li>Translated to English in Nairobi, 1925</li>
<li>This is a translation of confessions of Alsophocus, a necromancer, allegedly living in the land of “Erongill,” a place lost to myth and fable. The book contains recordings of numerous magical rites and spell castings, much like a diary of the necromancer’s magical practice. In later parts, there is an account where Alsophocus purports to send his mind to Sharnoth “beyond time and earthly realms” where Nyarlathotep rules in a “great ebony palace.”</li>

<li>Single scroll, parchment, stored in a carved ivory scroll case with silver filigree decorations.</li>
<li>The poems contained on this scroll tell how the monk Liu meets a goddess who hides her face behind a black fan. The goddess seduces the author, telling Liu her true name and how to call her from behind the fan. He follows her bidding, and is struck with horror when he sees the Bloated Woman. Losing all reason, he writes a last poem in his own blood after gutting himself with a sickle.</li>

<li>They describe Nyarlathop’s aspect of Ahtu but do not mention the name Nyarlatotep or other aspects of the god. Some parts of the scroll have just recently been written and confirm that the White Apes finally managed to summon the “Demon”. Ahtu demanded them to do this because by the beginning of the next “human’s year”, Ahtu will need this “Demon” to “open the Gate”.</li>

<li>Largely concerned with the nature and habits of what scholars of the period perceived of as “demonic creatures”. Wenn’s manuscript also contains a number of protective charms, as well as other incantations designed to inconvenience one’s rivals. It also discusses Wenn’s own peculiar interpretation of the different schools of magic (black, white, etc.).</li>

<h2 id="baneful-dust-of-hermes-trismegistus">Baneful Dust of Hermes Trismegistus</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> 4 magic points</li>
<li><strong>Casting time:</strong> 24 hours (1 round to use)</li>
</ul>
<p>This spell only affects creatures of non-terrestrial origin (that excludes humans, deep ones, ghouls, sand dwellers, serpent people, etc., but not flying polyps, elder things, mi-go, or star- spawn of Cthulhu, and so on).</p>
<p>Anyone may use the gold-colored dust created by the spell. The dust ’s effects are horrible and cost sensitive observers 0/1D3 Sanity points to see. A creature covered in the dust flinches and flails, and sometimes screams. Its body smokes and burns, as if eaten by powerful acid. Only the most fearsome entities continue to fight after an application of this terrible dust.</p>
<p>To apply the dust requires that the target be within throwing range. With a successful Throw roll, the dust burns the extraterrestrial creature for 2D6 points of damage. Armor does not protect against the dust. Each successful throw of the dust causes the same damage. If the Throw is missed, the nimbus of the dust still inflicts 1 hit point of damage. The creature escapes damage only if the Throw roll is fumbled. The formula for the dust requires uncommon chemicals and ingredients in a proportion of combined weight roughly equal to two pounds. Two ounces of this concoction is enough for one dose. Sixteen doses can be made each time the formula is prepared. Brewing the dust is a consuming job, taking 24 hours to prepare and dry the mixture. 4 magic points are invested, and a successful Science (Chemistry, Pharmacy) or Medicine roll is required for a batch to work; the Keeper should make this roll in secret, as the caster should have no idea if a batch will be effective.</p>
<h2 id="create-barrier-of-naach-tith">Create Barrier of Naach-Tith</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> variable magic points; 1D10 Sanity points</li>
<li><strong>Casting time:</strong> 1 minute</li>
</ul>
<p>The barrier provides both a physical and magical defense. Each participant in this spell loses 1D10 Sanity points and a variable number of magic points. Each magic point expended in the creation provides the barrier 3D10 points of STR. The spell takes 1 minute to cast (during which time all magic points to be used must be expended) and the resulting barrier lasts 1D4+4 hours. Anyone who knows the spell may participate in the casting and contribute magic points to the barrier.</p>
<p>The barrier is spherical in shape and about 100 yards in diameter. It can be cast around the casters to protect from harm or it can be cast to encompass a monster or enemy. Any creature bisected by the barrier’s boundary upon its creation is unharmed and thrust outside the barrier. Anything trapped should be allowed a STR roll opposed by the STR of the barrier. Multiple entrapped victims cannot combine their STR to escape. A bullet or missile can cross the barrier if the rolled damage (ignore impales) to the barrier is greater than a fifth of the barrier’s STR. If penetrating the barrier, the object does the damage rolled, as if the barrier did not exist, and the barrier is destroyed.</p>
<h2 id="go-beyond">Go Beyond</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> 15 magic points; 1 Sanity point</li>
<li><strong>Casting time:</strong> 1 day</li>
</ul>
<p>A long ritual whereby the caster chants or performs some other ritualized repetition to enter a trance state (an altered state of consciousness). Once the altered state has been achieved, the caster is able to send their “spirit” to another plane of existence; which plane may be determined by the caster (if they know of and comprehend its existence), or could be random—conceivably, even, to the location of a Mythos deity or perhaps the Dreamlands. The trance lasts 1D6+3 hours. Depending on where the caster’s spirit travels and what it sees, Sanity losses (possibly quite high) are likely.</p>
<h2 id="restore-life">Restore Life</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cost: 3 magic points; 1D10 Sanity points</li>
<li>Casting time: 1 or 2 rounds</li>
</ul>
<p>The spell reduces a corpse to its essential salts and compounds, a bluish-grey powder, or reverses the process to yield ultimately the form and soul of the deceased. A complete corpse is necessary.</p>
<p>Being Resurrected in this manner costs the victim 1D20 Sanity points.</p>
<p>If only part of the ashy powder is available for the spell, the sorcerer gets “onlie the liveliest awfullness” from what’s then made flesh. But the successfully resurrected need not be all in one piece—as long as the coffin is intact and sufficient care is taken to scrape together all the fragments and dust within, the spell succeeds.</p>
<p>Reciting the spell backward returns the resurrected entity to dust and likewise requires the expenditure of 3 magic points and 1D10 Sanity points. The dust can be retained or thrown away. For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target. If the caster wins, the victim returns to dust. If the victim wins, it may try to prevent the caster from reciting the spell again. Reciting the spell backward takes two rounds. In The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, many of those resurrected were interrogated and tortured to reveal secrets of the past.</p>
<h2 id="ye-terrible-cloud">Ye Terrible Cloud</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cost: 2 magic points</li>
<li>Casting time: Instantaneous</li>
</ul>
<p>The spell causes a dense mist to appear in an egg-shaped volume (10 × 10 × 15 feet), directly in front of the caster. The long axis of the cloud is always at right angles to the direction in which the caster faces. The spell obscures vision for 1D6+4 game rounds and then evaporates without trace.</p>
