## Équinoxe Divisé

-   Found: Penhew Foundation
-   French, by Ghyslain D’Aramitz, 1807.
-   Octavo, soft calf leather binding, pages untrimmed.
-  The account of a French merchant, colonial administrator, and explorer telling of his experiences traveling around the world, with particular chapters devoted to cataloguing and comparing regional customs and beliefs in Northern Africa, Asia, and Europe. D’Aramitz relishes in describing what appear to be outlandish (possibly fictional) practices concerning farming and hunting; however, these are interspersed with dramatic and chilling folk customs that have the ring of authenticity. A number of apparent medieval rituals, stemming from the south of France, are shown to have dark and murderous origins. 
- There are numerous mentions of god- like entities and avatars: “Witch Maker,” “Bloody Tongue,” and “Three-Eyed Shadow”. Of particular relevance is a description of a mark cut into the skin of enemies of the Bloody Tongue (the same as seen on Jackson Elias’ forehead). Additionally, a passage details an excursion to find the “Black Mountain where the Bloody Tongue dwells” in “Kirinyaga”, where D’Aramitz claims to have seen unholy rites.

Particular mention is made of “the Terrible Lord of the Riverbanks,” the crocodile-headed Sebek. His riverside temples are described, along with the rituals for sacrifices made in his name. Cautionary chapters, devoted to the darker members of the Egyptian pantheon, are also included.

 # Spells
 ## Baneful Dust of Hermes Trismegistus

* **Cost:** 4 magic points
* **Casting time:** 24 hours (1 round to use)

This spell only affects creatures of non-terrestrial origin (that excludes humans, deep ones, ghouls, sand dwellers, serpent people, etc., but not flying polyps, elder things, mi-go, or star- spawn of Cthulhu, and so on). 

Anyone may use the gold-colored dust created by the spell. The dust ’s effects are horrible and cost sensitive observers 0/1D3 Sanity points to see. A creature covered in the dust flinches and flails, and sometimes screams. Its body smokes and burns, as if eaten by powerful acid. Only the most fearsome entities continue to fight after an application of this terrible dust.

To apply the dust requires that the target be within throwing range. With a successful Throw roll, the dust burns the extraterrestrial creature for 2D6 points of damage. Armor does not protect against the dust. Each successful throw of the dust causes the same damage. If the Throw is missed, the nimbus of the dust still inflicts 1 hit point of damage. The creature escapes damage only if the Throw roll is fumbled. The formula for the dust requires uncommon chemicals and ingredients in a proportion of combined weight roughly equal to two pounds. Two ounces of this concoction is enough for one dose. Sixteen doses can be made each time the formula is prepared. Brewing the dust is a consuming job, taking 24 hours to prepare and dry the mixture. 4 magic points are invested, and a successful Science (Chemistry, Pharmacy) or Medicine roll is required for a batch to work; the Keeper should make this roll in secret, as the caster should have no idea if a batch will be effective.

 ## Create Barrier of Naach-Tith
 
 * **Cost:** variable magic points; 1D10 Sanity points
* **Casting time:** 1 minute

The barrier provides both a physical and magical defense. Each participant in this spell loses 1D10 Sanity points and a variable number of magic points. Each magic point expended in the creation provides the barrier 3D10 points of STR. The spell takes 1 minute to cast (during which time all magic points to be used must be expended) and the resulting barrier lasts 1D4+4 hours. Anyone who knows the spell may participate in the casting and contribute magic points to the barrier.

The barrier is spherical in shape and about 100 yards in diameter. It can be cast around the casters to protect from harm or it can be cast to encompass a monster or enemy. Any creature bisected by the barrier’s boundary upon its creation is unharmed and thrust outside the barrier. Anything trapped should be allowed a STR roll opposed by the STR of the barrier. Multiple entrapped victims cannot combine their STR to escape. A bullet or missile can cross the barrier if the rolled damage (ignore impales) to the barrier is greater than a fifth of the barrier’s STR. If penetrating the barrier, the object does the damage rolled, as if the barrier did not exist, and the barrier is destroyed.
